# Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software

This course is offered at <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> and is part of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming">Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals</a>.

# Note:

Some code uses custom libraries which you can find only in the custom BlueJ environement provided by Duke University especially for this course. You can get the IDE from the University website <a href="http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2">here</a>.

<hr>

I am still learning the course. I will keep uploading the code as I finish each week and will also put up a link to the certificate upon completion. Hope this helps, thank you!
