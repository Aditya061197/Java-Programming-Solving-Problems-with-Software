I completed this course within five days, owing to the extra time I have due to the lockdown. The link to the certificate is <a href="https://coursera.org/share/119b568a399d76cae31d772015f4cbc8">here</a>.
This was a great course for introductory level programming and I recommend everyone to enrol in it. Hope this helps, thanks!
